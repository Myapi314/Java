# Overview

<!-- {Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

This is a simple beginner project using the Java language. The goal was to practice the basic programming concepts using Java to build a tic-tac-toe game. There is a Board class which holds the concept of the board. It controls displaying, updating, clearing, and checking the board for win conditions. The Main class controls the flow and set up of the game.

<!-- {Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.} -->

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.} -->

# Development Environment

<!-- {Describe the tools that you used to develop the software} -->

<!-- {Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.} -->

This program was developed using openJDK from Oracle and the extensions to integrate Java into a Visual Studio Code terminal.

# Next Steps

<!-- {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.} -->

Going forward I would like to develop other projects in Java, specifically, my goal is to create an app using the popular Android Studio, and use Java for developing that.

For this project I would like to continue to practice using Java by expanding this into a GUI using Swing. Tic-tac-toe was a simpler game to implement so it may be more practical to try and recreate other games to expand my use of the language and be able to use concepts like interfaces and inheritance.
